## Configuration

First, add the Cashier package to your `composer.json` file:

	"laravel/cashier": "~1.0"

To use Cashier, we'll need to add several columns to your database. Don't worry, you can use the `cashier:table` Artisan command to create a migration to add the necessary column. Once the migration has been created, simply run the `migrate` command.

Next, add the BillableTrait and appropriate date mutators to your model definition:

	use Laravel\Cashier\BillableTrait;

	class User extends Eloquent {

		use BillableTrait;

		protected $dates = ['trial_ends_at', 'subscription_ends_at'];

	}

## Subscribing To A Plan

Once you have a model instance, you can easily subscribe that user to a given Stripe plane:

	$user = User::find(1);

	$user->subscription('monthly')->create($creditCardToken);

If you would like to apply a coupon when creating the subscription, you may use the `withCoupon` method:

	$user->subscription('monthly')
         ->withCoupon('code')
         ->create($creditCardToken);

The `subscription` method will automatically create the Stripe subscription, as well as update your database with Stripe customer ID and other relevant billing information. If your plan includes a trial, the trial end date will also automatically be set on the user record.

If your plan has a trial period, make sure to set the trial end date on your model after subscribing:

	$user->trial_ends_at = Carbon::now()->addDays(14);

	$user->save();

<a name="no-card-up-front"></a>
## No Card Up Front

If your application offers a free-trial with no credit-card up front, set the `cardUpFront` property on your model to `false`:

	protected $cardUpFront = false;

On account creation, be sure to set the trial end date on the model:

	$user->trial_ends_at = Carbon::now()->addDays(14);

	$user->save();

<a name="swapping-subscriptions"></a>
## Swapping Subscriptions

To swap a user to a new subscription, use the `swap` method:

	$user->subscription('premium')->swap();

If the user is on trial, the trial will be maintained as normal. Also, if a "quantity" exists for the subscription, that quantity will also be maintained.

## Cancelling A Subscription

Cancelling a subscription is a walk in the park:

	$user->subscription()->cancel();

When a subscription is cancelled, Cashier will automatically set the `subscription_ends_at` column on your database. This column is used to know when the `subscribed` method should begin returning `false`. For example, if a customer cancels a subscription on March 1st, but the subscription was not scheduled to end until March 5th, the `subscribed` method will continue to return `true` until March 5th.

## Resuming A Subscription

If a user has cancelled their subscription and you wish to resume it, use the `resume` method:

	$user->subscription('monthly')->resume($creditCardToken);

If the user cancels a subscription and then resumes that subscription before the subscription has fully expired, they will not be billed immediately. Their subscription will simply be re-activated, and they will be billed on the original billing cycle.

## Checking Subscription Status

To verify that a user is subscribed to your application, use the `subscribed` command:

	if ($user->subscribed())
	{
		//
	}

You may also determine if the user is still within their trial period (if applicable) using the `onTrial` method:

	if ($user->onTrial())
	{
		//
	}

To determine if the user was once an active subscriber, but has cancelled their subscription, you may use the `cancelled` method:

	if ($user->cancelled())
	{
		//
	}

You may also determine if a user has cancelled their subscription, but are still on their "grace period" until the subscription fully expires. For example, if a user cancels a subscription on March 5th that was scheduled to end on March 10th, the user is on their "grace period" until March 10th. Note that the `subscribed` method still returns `true` during this time.

	if ($user->onGracePeriod())
	{
		//
	}

The `everSubscribed` method may be used to determine if the user has ever subscribed to a plan in your application:

	if ($user->everSubscribed())
	{
		//
	}

## Invoices

You can easily retrieve an array of a user's invoices using the `invoices` method:

	$invoices = $user->invoices();

When listing the invoices for the customer, you may use these helper methods to display the relevant invoice information:

	{{ $invoice->id }}

	{{ $invoice->dateString() }}

	{{ $invoice->dollars() }}

Use the `downloadInvoice` method to generate a PDF download of the invoice. Yes, it's really this easy:

	return $user->downloadInvoice($invoice->id, [
		'vendor'  => 'Your Company',
		'product' => 'Your Product',
	]);
